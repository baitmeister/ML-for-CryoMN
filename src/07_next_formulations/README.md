# Step 7: Next Formulations

## Overview

This module builds the next wet-lab batch from the active model state.

It always writes exactly **20 formulations** with an adaptive exploit/explore split:

- exploitation count is diagnostics-driven (default baseline 8, bounded to 4..12)
- exploration/calibration count is the remaining rows to keep total batch size fixed at 20

The script is intentionally strict. It validates required inputs before
generation, validates all 20 outputs again before write, and aborts without
writing partial results if anything is inconsistent.

## Usage

```bash
python src/07_next_formulations/next_formulations.py
```

Optional flags:

```bash
python src/07_next_formulations/next_formulations.py --stage 4
python src/07_next_formulations/next_formulations.py --overwrite
python src/07_next_formulations/next_formulations.py --allow-coverage-shortfall
```

## Inputs

- `models/model_metadata.json` to resolve the active target stage
- `models/<iteration_dir>/` for the active model artifacts and observed context
- `models/<previous_iteration_dir>/` or `models/literature_only/` for the last completed stage model
- `data/validation/validation_results.csv` for stage detection and residual learning
- `results/bo_candidates_general_<iteration_tag>.csv`
- `results/bo_candidates_dmso_free_<iteration_tag>.csv`

The stage sequence must be contiguous. If the active stage is iteration `N`,
`validation_results.csv` must contain completed wet-lab results through stage `N-1`.

## Selection Logic

### Exploitation

- source only from `05` BO candidate files
- normalize loaded BO candidates with the same practical concentration floor used by `05`
- drop already tested formulations
- apply active-model calibration metadata (`bias_shift_percent`, `uncertainty_scale`) to prediction mean/std before ranking
- rank by predicted viability with uncertainty and acquisition tie-breaks
- keep a simple chemistry-family diversity cap so exploitation rows are not all near-duplicates
- final exploitation count comes from recent diagnostics (`rmse`, `mean_signed_residual`, `coverage_1sigma`) on stage `N-1`

### Exploration / Calibration

- compute residuals on stage `N-1` using that stage's frozen model
- aggregate historical positive-residual anchors across all completed wet-lab stages
- try positive-residual anchor thresholds in descending order: `10.0`, `8.0`, `5.0`, `2.0`, `0.0`
- convert positive residuals into feature-level and pair-level blind-spot signals
- generate local-rank probes from the top exploitation anchors by scaling the top two active ingredients down and up
- select exactly 2 BO-only `coverage_probe` rows via greedy k-center farthest-first distance from observed context
- generate blind-spot probes by midpoint interpolation or local perturbation around underpredicted anchors from historical positive-residual stages
- clip to BO bounds, zero sub-threshold trace ingredients, and enforce the BO-derived ingredient-count limit
- re-score with the active model
- keep local-rank and blind-spot probes ahead of BO fallback, even if a relaxed family cap is needed to fill the exploration bucket
- set local-rank/blind-spot target counts adaptively from the chosen exploit/explore split after reserving the fixed 2-slot coverage quota
- backfill from BO only if fewer than the target exploration rows survive after the generated-only top-up pass

Coverage shortfall policy:
- default behavior is strict: if fewer than 2 valid coverage probes can be selected, the run fails with `ValidationError`
- optional override `--allow-coverage-shortfall` permits shortfall and lets BO fallback rows backfill missing exploration slots

This is why `07` does not use `03_optimization` as a primary source. The
exploration half is designed directly from model failures, not from a random
candidate pool.

## Outputs

Outputs are written under:

- `results/next_formulations/<iteration_tag>/next_formulations.csv`
- `results/next_formulations/<iteration_tag>/next_formulations_summary.txt`
- `results/next_formulations/<iteration_tag>/next_formulations_metadata.json`
- `results/next_formulations/<iteration_tag>/input_validation.json`
- `results/next_formulations/<iteration_tag>/batch_recommendations.json`
- `results/next_formulations/<iteration_tag>/batch_recommendations.csv`

`next_formulations.csv` includes:

- recommendation type and bucket rank
- origin and source file / rank when applicable
- anchor stage and anchor experiments for generated probes
- predicted viability and uncertainty
- blind-spot and novelty scores
- canonical feature columns in model order
- formulation text and rationale

`batch_recommendations.json` and `batch_recommendations.csv` include one
recommended subset for each wet-lab batch size from 6 through 12. The subset
search is exact over the generated 20-row slate and uses a heuristic utility
score that balances:

- predicted viability
- uncertainty
- blind-spot value
- novelty
- chemistry-family diversity
- the intended adaptive exploit / local-rank / blind-spot mix

`next_formulations_summary.txt` also includes a text version of each
recommended subset. For every batch size, the summary lists the selected rows,
their recommendation type and origin, predicted viability, uncertainty, and
per-row utility.

The printed recommendation `score` is a heuristic subset-selection score. It
does not mean predicted viability, expected improvement, or probability of
success. It is the objective used to choose one subset over another within the
same 20-row slate:

- start with the sum of per-row `batch_utility`
- add bonuses for chemistry-family diversity and distinct local-rank anchors
- subtract penalties when the subset drifts away from the target exploit /
  local-rank / blind-spot counts

This makes the score useful for comparing subsets generated in the same run,
but not as an absolute quantity across different stages or different slates.

The printed row `utility` is the heuristic row-level value that feeds into the
subset score. It is role-dependent:

- `exploit` rows emphasize predicted viability, confidence, and novelty
- `local_rank_probe` rows balance predicted viability, uncertainty, blind-spot value, and novelty
- `blindspot_probe` rows emphasize uncertainty and blind-spot value
- `explore_fallback` rows follow the exploration weighting but carry a small penalty

So `utility` is a single-row selection value, while `score` is the full
subset-level selection value.

Displayed formulation identity follows the same floor as BO generation and `06`
matching:

- `_pct` values `<0.1%` are omitted
- `_M` values `<0.001 M` (`<1.0 mM`) are omitted

The metadata and input-validation artifacts record residual thresholds, selected
threshold, exploration-row sources (local-rank probes, blind-spot probes, BO
fallback), historical anchor stages for generated probes, and scoring details
for each recommended smaller batch. Adaptive split fields include:

- `adaptive_split_policy`
- `adaptive_split_diagnostics`
- `adaptive_split_triggered_rules`
- `exploit_count`, `explore_count`
- `local_rank_probe_target_count`, `blindspot_probe_target_count`, `coverage_probe_target_count`
- `coverage_probe_count`, `coverage_probe_shortfall`, `coverage_shortfall_allowed`
- `coverage_pool_rows`, `coverage_reference_rows`, `coverage_selected_signatures`
- `coverage_selected_min_distance_to_known`, `coverage_min_distance_stats`
- `generated_explore_count`, `fallback_explore_count`

## Failure Mode

This module fails hard on:

- missing or malformed validation columns
- missing model artifacts or BO candidate files
- feature-space mismatches across validation data, models, and candidate files
- non-contiguous stage history
- duplicate or already tested final outputs
- violations of BO bounds, DMSO cap, or effective ingredient-count limits

If the run succeeds, `input_validation.json` records exactly which inputs were
used so repeated runs can be audited.
