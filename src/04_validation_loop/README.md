# Step 4: Validation Loop

## Overview

This module integrates wet lab validation results to iteratively refine the GP model. It includes three update scripts with different approaches for incorporating validation data.

## Scripts

| Script | Method | Best For |
|--------|--------|----------|
| `update_model.py` | Simple concatenation | Baseline (no weighting) |
| `update_model_weighted_simple.py` | Sample duplication (10x) | Quick experiments |
| `update_model_weighted_prior.py` | Prior mean + correction | When literature has systematic bias |
| `compare_update_methods.py` | Shadow rolling comparison | Comparing update methods without activating any candidate |

## Usage

### First Time Setup

```bash
cd "/path/to/project"
python src/04_validation_loop/update_model.py
```

This creates a validation template at `data/validation/validation_template.csv`.

### After Wet Lab Experiments

1. Copy template to `data/validation/validation_results.csv`
2. Fill in experimental viability values
3. Choose and run a script:

```bash
# Option 1: No weighting
python src/04_validation_loop/update_model.py

# Option 2: Simple weighting (10x duplication)
python src/04_validation_loop/update_model_weighted_simple.py

# Option 3: Prior mean + correction
python src/04_validation_loop/update_model_weighted_prior.py
```

### Evaluate Model Stages Against Wet-Lab Batches

Stage-based scoring is handled in `06_evaluation_explainability` so the
post-update analysis lives in one place:

```bash
python src/06_evaluation_explainability/evaluate_iterations.py
```

That evaluator:
- scores literature-only and iteration-specific frozen outputs against the wet-lab batch each stage actually produced
- writes JSON, CSV, and plot artifacts under `results/evaluation/`
- provides the stage residual signals consumed later by `07_next_formulations`
- audits saved `07` recommendation slates when `results/next_formulations/<iteration_tag>/next_formulations.csv` exists

### Generate the Next Validation Batch

The evaluation outputs from `src/06_evaluation_explainability/evaluate_iterations.py`
are one of the inputs to the dedicated next-batch generator in
`src/07_next_formulations/next_formulations.py`:

```bash
python src/07_next_formulations/next_formulations.py
```

That script is separate from the update loop:

- `04_validation_loop` measures how the frozen stages performed
- `07_next_formulations` uses stage residuals plus active BO outputs to choose the next 20 formulations
- the exploit/explore split is adaptive (default 8/12 baseline, diagnostics-driven adjustment bounded to exploit 4..12)
- the exploration bucket is assembled from local-rank probes, blind-spot probes, and BO fallback only when needed
- the output directory also includes recommended subsets for wet-lab capacities from 6 to 12 formulations
- the run is strict: it fails before writing if the active stage, validation stage sequence, or required BO artifacts are inconsistent

### Compare Candidate Update Methods Without Activation

The shadow comparison workflow reuses the production training paths without
touching the active model registry:

```bash
python src/04_validation_loop/compare_update_methods.py
```

It:
- trains each candidate method in-memory only
- evaluates each candidate on later completed stages using a rolling retrospective split
- writes comparison artifacts under `results/model_comparison/`
- produces `recommended_method.json` with either `switch`, `keep_incumbent`, or `no_switch`

The update scripts train on raw wet-lab numeric concentrations. The
practical concentration floor used by `05`, `06`, and `07` changes candidate
generation and formulation identity matching, not the retraining inputs.

## Wet-Lab Cross-Validation

The update scripts do not use one permanent static train/test split. Instead,
they estimate wet-lab generalization by cross-validating the wet-lab rows while
always retaining the literature rows in fold training.

Implementation details:

- fold count is `min(5, len(X_val))`
- `KFold` uses `shuffle=True` and `random_state=42`
- if fewer than 2 wet-lab rows are available, `validation_rmse` is reported as `NaN`

Per method:

- standard update: each fold trains on `literature + wetlab_train_fold` and predicts the held-out wet-lab fold
- weighted-simple update: same split, but the training-fold wet-lab rows are duplicated according to the selected weight multiplier before fitting
- prior-mean correction update: the literature GP stays fixed, literature predictions are computed for all wet-lab rows, and only the wet-lab residual correction GP is cross-validated across the wet-lab folds

### ⚠️ Before Running Any Update Script

> **These scripts overwrite the active model in `models/`.** Run them on a branch or commit your working tree first so you have a clean rollback point.

## Validation CSV Format

The CSV uses **full feature names** with `_M` (molar) or `_pct` (percentage) suffixes to match the model's feature names:

```csv
experiment_id,experiment_date,viability_measured,notes,acetamide_M,betaine_M,...,dmso_M,...,ethylene_glycol_M,fbs_pct,...,glycerol_M,...,hsa_pct,...,trehalose_M
EXP101,2026-02-04,21.01,"33.0mM DMSO + 2.07M ethylene glycol",0,0,...,0.033,...,2.07,0,...,0,...,0,...,0
EXP205,2026-02-11,63.31,"34.7% FBS + 2.35M glycerol + 6.0% HSA",0,0,...,0,...,0,34.7,...,2.35,...,6,...,0
```

**Notes**:
- Columns include all 34 ingredient features — set unused ingredients to `0`
- Molar concentrations (`_M`) are in **mol/L** (e.g., 33 mM DMSO → `0.033`)
- Percentage ingredients (`_pct`) are in **%** (e.g., 34.7% FBS → `34.7`)
- Use the `validation_template.csv` as a starting point to ensure all columns are present

## Weighting Approaches

### Option A: Sample Duplication (`update_model_weighted_simple.py`)

Each wet lab sample is duplicated 10x before combining with literature data.

**Configuration** (edit at top of script):
```python
VALIDATION_WEIGHT_MULTIPLIER = 10  # Increase for more wet lab influence
```

**Pros:**
- Simple and intuitive
- Works with standard GP
- Easy to tune

### Option B: Prior Mean + Correction (`update_model_weighted_prior.py`)

Uses literature GP as prior mean, wet lab GP models corrections.

**Configuration:**
```python
ALPHA_LITERATURE = 1.0
ALPHA_WETLAB = 0.02
```

`ALPHA_LITERATURE` and `ALPHA_WETLAB` are global source-level GP noise
hyperparameters, not per-point edits. They are fixed numeric assumptions for
all runs under this policy:

- literature rows share one fixed alpha (`1.0`)
- wet-lab rows share one fixed alpha (`0.02`)

After fitting with fixed alphas, the script computes post-hoc calibration
metadata from wet-lab CV residual diagnostics:

- `bias_shift_percent`
- `uncertainty_scale`
- raw and calibrated coverage diagnostics (for example `cv_coverage_1sigma*`)

Produced metadata keys include:

- `alpha_literature`, `alpha_wetlab`, `noise_ratio`
- `bias_shift_percent`, `uncertainty_scale`
- `cv_coverage_1sigma`, `cv_coverage_2sigma`
- `cv_mean_signed_residual`, `cv_mean_abs_residual`
- `cv_coverage_1sigma_calibrated`, `cv_coverage_2sigma_calibrated`

Data integrity:

- wet-lab measurements in `validation_results.csv` are never altered
- model fit uses measured labels
- calibration adjusts predicted mean/std outputs, not the measured outcomes

**Pros:**
- Corrects systematic biases
- Meaningful uncertainty
- Works with very few samples

**Output:** Creates a `CompositeGP` model with both components.

## Model Selection Behavior

Each update script stamps the trained iteration with explicit identity fields:
- `iteration`
- `iteration_dir`
- `model_method`
- `is_composite_model`

The same identity is also appended to `data/validation/iteration_history.json`.

Downstream scripts use the active metadata in different ways:

- `update_model.py` and `update_model_weighted_simple.py` mark the active model as **standard GP**
- `update_model_weighted_prior.py` marks the active model as **composite GP**
- `03_optimization`, `05_bo_optimization`, and `06_evaluation_explainability` share the same iteration-aware resolver
- the shared resolver validates metadata against iteration history and does **not** fall back automatically across model types
- each update script writes `models/<iteration_dir>/observed_context.csv` and mirrors the active copy to `models/observed_context.csv`
- `03`, `05`, and `06` all load that observed context first and reconstruct it on demand if it is missing

Whenever an update script activates a newly trained iteration by replacing `models/model_metadata.json`, it prints a notice that the active metadata is being overwritten and identifies the target iteration/method.

## Output

- Trained checkpoint in `models/iteration_N_<method>/`
- Active model mirror in `models/`
- **Observed context** in `models/iteration_N_<method>/observed_context.csv` and `models/observed_context.csv`
- **Compatibility evaluation data** in `data/processed/evaluation_data.csv` (mirror written by `update_model_weighted_prior.py`)
- Iteration history in `data/validation/iteration_history.json`
- Shadow comparison artifacts in `results/model_comparison/` when `compare_update_methods.py` is run

The canonical observed context CSV includes a `context_weight` column (1.0 for literature, weighted values for wet lab), a `source` column, and iteration identity fields. `03`, `05`, and `06` use this file as the source of truth for the active iteration. The compatibility evaluation data CSV keeps the `weight` column for prior-mean compatibility only.

## Iteration Tracking

Each iteration is logged with:
- Timestamp
- Iteration number and iteration directory
- Model method and whether the model is composite
- Number of validation samples
- Wet-lab cross-validated RMSE (`validation_rmse`), computed from the wet-lab-only K-fold procedure described above
- Wet-lab in-sample RMSE (`wetlab_train_rmse` in model metadata)
- Weighting method and parameters
